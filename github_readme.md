## 📋 Project Overview

The **Automated Customer Order Validation System** is a comprehensive database solution designed for e-commerce platforms to streamline order processing, enforce business rules, and maintain complete audit trails. Built entirely in PL/SQL for Oracle Database, this system eliminates manual verification errors and ensures data integrity across all transactions.



## 🎯 Problem Statement

Modern e-commerce businesses face critical challenges in order processing: manual validation leads to errors such as accepting orders for non-existent products, insufficient stock, or suspended customers. Additionally, unrestricted database access during business hours poses data integrity risks, and the lack of comprehensive audit trails creates compliance issues and makes troubleshooting difficult.

## 🚀 Key Objectives

1. - **Automate order validation** - Validate customers, products, stock, and credit limits automatically
2. - **Enforce business rules** - Restrict database modifications to weekends only (non-holidays)
3. - **Comprehensive auditing** - Log all operations with user context, timestamps, and outcomes
4. - **Data integrity** - Prevent invalid transactions through triggers and constraints
5. - **Business intelligence** - Provide analytical views for decision-making
6. - **Error handling** - Capture and log all failed operations with clear messages

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Database Components

- **12 Tables** - Customers, Products, Orders, Users, Payments, Feedback, Auditing
- **5 Functions** - Validation, calculation, and lookup operations
- **5 Procedures** - Order placement, status updates, payments, feedback, restocking
- **1 Package** - `pkg_order_management` with 6 public methods
- **9 Triggers** - Business rule enforcement and automatic auditing
- **4 BI Views** - Window functions for analytics and rankings
- **1,000+ Records** - Realistic test data across all tables

### Key Features

- 🔐 **Time-based Access Control** - Weekday/holiday restrictions
- 📊 **Real-time Analytics** - Customer rankings, product trends, sales reports
- 🔍 **Complete Audit Trail** - Every operation logged with user context
- ⚡ **Performance Optimized** - Bulk operations, proper indexing

## 📊 Sample Usage

### Place an Order
```sql
DECLARE
    v_order_id NUMBER;
    v_status VARCHAR2(100);
    v_message VARCHAR2(500);
BEGIN
    sp_place_order(
        p_customer_id => 1001,
        p_product_id => 2001,
        p_quantity => 5,
        p_user_id => 3001,
        p_order_id => v_order_id,
        p_status => v_status,
        p_message => v_message
    );
    
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Status: ' || v_status);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Message: ' || v_message);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Order ID: ' || v_order_id);
END;
/
```

### Process Payment
```sql
DECLARE
    v_transaction_id NUMBER;
    v_status VARCHAR2(100);
    v_message VARCHAR2(500);
BEGIN
    sp_process_payment(
        p_order_id => 4001,
        p_payment_method => 'Credit Card',
        p_amount => 118000,
        p_user_id => 3005,
        p_transaction_id => v_transaction_id,
        p_status => v_status,
        p_message => v_message
    );
    
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Transaction ID: ' || v_transaction_id);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Status: ' || v_status);
END;
/
```

### View Top Customers
```sql
SELECT 
    customer_name,
    city,
    total_spent,
    order_count,
    spending_rank
FROM vw_customer_rankings
WHERE ROWNUM <= 10
ORDER BY spending_rank;
```
